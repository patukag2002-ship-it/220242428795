## 1. Why is the term **data mining** often used to describe the entire knowledge discovery process?

The full Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process includes several stages such as data cleaning, preparation, mining, and interpretation. However, the term **data mining** is often used to describe the whole process because the mining step is the most central and visible part. It is during this stage that algorithms actually uncover patterns or insights from the data, making it the part most people associate with “discovering knowledge.” As a result, the entire KDD workflow is sometimes casually referred to as data mining.

## 2. Differences between data wrangling, scanning, and filtering

**Data Wrangling:**  
The process of cleaning, correcting, and transforming raw data into a structured and usable form. This may involve fixing inconsistencies, handling missing values, or merging different sources of data.

**Data Scanning:**  
The initial examination of data to understand its structure, quality, and potential issues. It includes identifying errors, anomalies, or unusual patterns before detailed processing begins.

**Data Filtering:**  
The act of selecting only the data that meets specific criteria and removing what is not needed. This step helps focus the dataset on the most relevant records or features for analysis.
